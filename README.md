operation:
  {filter,map,scan,generate}
    filter              filter down the threat model data.
    map                 map threat model data to OSCAL framework.
    scan                scan threat model data against patterns.
    generate            generate threat specific PNGs from XML data.
```
You can also get more help on each operation:
```sh
# help for `filter` and `map` operations.

```
## Usage
Details for supported 
### Filter

The `filter` operation allows you to filter relevant information from a ThreatModel JSON based on various criteria, such as future class, threat severity, or IAM permission.
```sh
$: tmxcaliber filter path/to/threatmodel.json --severity high
```

### Map

The `map` operation allows you to map a ThreatModel control objectives to various frameworks/standards/regulations from the Secure Control Framework (SCF). In order to map, you need to download the OSCAL version of the SCF ([here](https://github.com/securecontrolsframework/scf-oscal-catalog-model/tree/main/SCF-OSCAL%20Releases), starting with 
JSON_Data_SCF) and choose one of the supported framework. The tool will execute and map every known control objective to SCF-supported frameworks.
```sh
$: tmxcaliber map path/to/threatmodel.json \
  --scf path/to/oscal.json \
  --framework "ISO\n27001\nv2013" \
  --format csv
```

### Map a framework not supported by the SCF
For non-supported frameworks, you must map your framework to the SCF within the OSCAL JSON. Once the mapping is done, you will be able to generate your mapping.
```sh
$: tmxcaliber map path/to/threatmodel.json \
  --scf path/to/oscal.json \
  --framework "My Framework" \
  --format csv
```

### Scan
The `scan` opreation allows you to scan the description of all the controls for a given pattern. Support for currently known Amazon GuardDuty findings pattern has also been added.
```sh
$: tmxcaliber scan path/to/threatmodel.json --pattern regex_pattern|guardduty_findings
```

### Generate
The `generate` operation allows you to create threat focused and feature class focused XMLs and PNGs of the DFD.
```sh
$: tmxcaliber generate path/to/threatmodel.json \
  --threat-dir path/to/threats \
  --fc-dir path/to/features \
  --out-dir images/
```
Threats focused XMLs will be saved in `--threat-dir`  
Feature class focused XMLs will be saved in `--fc-dir`  
All the DFD images will be saved in `--out-dir`
